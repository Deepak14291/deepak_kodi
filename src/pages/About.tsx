                        Hello! I'm Deepak Kodi, a recent masters graduate in mobile and web development from the
                        university of the west of scotland. My passion for technology and problem-solving stems from my 7 years
                        of experience at Concentrix, where I worked as a senior subject matter expert on the Microsoft outlook
                        in-app support team.
                    </div>

                    <div className="mt-4 ">
                        During my time at Concentrix, I specialised in troubleshooting technical issues, assisting my
                        team
                        with
                        complex
                        cases, and working closely with microsoft outlook's engineering team to identify and resolve
                        product
                        bugs. I
                        also contributed by providing suggestions for articles and blogs to help reduce repeated support
                        cases
                        on
                        common
                        issues.
                    </div>
                    <div className="mt-4">
                        My curiosity about the inner workings of software development and the desire to understand how
                        bugs
                        were
                        fixed
                        and how features were created, drove me to transition into the field of software engineering.
                        Now,
                        with
                        a
                        solid
                        foundation in web and mobile development, I'm excited to take on new challenges, not just
                        supporting
                        applications in post production but in the creation of software application.
